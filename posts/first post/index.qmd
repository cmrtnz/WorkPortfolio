Hello! Today I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample dataset "Boston" to find the characteristics of this dataset containing housing information for housing located in the Boston area. After performing EDA, I will create a simple linear model and make a prediction on a sample record of the median house value of an area.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(ISLR2)

mydata <- ISLR2::Boston
head(mydata)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mydata)
```

Let's take a look at the distribution of our response variable, medv (median house values)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=medv))+
  geom_histogram(fill="blue") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of median house values")
```

Note that this is a unimodal distribution, with most home values hovering around 20.

Now let's look at one of the possible predictors of median house values, crime rate, and how that relates to the median house values in a scatterplot

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=crim, y=medv))+
  geom_point()

```

For this specific case, there appears to possibly be an inverse relationship between house value and crime, but it is hard to tell since so many of the houses have a crime value of 0 or near to 0. Interestingly, it appears that there are no instances of high median house value (\>30) that have any crime value over 10.

To identify some other potential variables, let's run a full correlation on the dataset with median house value. From there, we can pick out the top 5 or so features by absolute value correlation score to include in our linear prediction model.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
correlation <- cor(mydata)
medv_correlation <- correlation[,ncol(correlation)]
medv_correlation <- sort(abs(medv_correlation), decreasing = TRUE)
medv_correlation
```

The top 5 values are lstat, rm, ptratio, indus, and tax. Let's now make a linear model predicting medv with these 5 values and see the summary of the model.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
model <- lm(medv~lstat + rm + ptratio + indus + tax, data = mydata)
summary(model)
```
