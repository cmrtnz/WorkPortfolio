    "text": "Hello! Today I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sample dataset “Boston” to find the characteristics of this dataset containing housing information for housing located in the Boston area. After performing EDA, I will create a simple linear model and make a prediction on a sample record of the median house value of an area.\n\nlibrary(ISLR2)\n\nWarning: package 'ISLR2' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nmydata &lt;- ISLR2::Boston\nhead(mydata)\n\n     crim zn indus chas   nox    rm  age    dis rad tax ptratio lstat medv\n1 0.00632 18  2.31    0 0.538 6.575 65.2 4.0900   1 296    15.3  4.98 24.0\n2 0.02731  0  7.07    0 0.469 6.421 78.9 4.9671   2 242    17.8  9.14 21.6\n3 0.02729  0  7.07    0 0.469 7.185 61.1 4.9671   2 242    17.8  4.03 34.7\n4 0.03237  0  2.18    0 0.458 6.998 45.8 6.0622   3 222    18.7  2.94 33.4\n5 0.06905  0  2.18    0 0.458 7.147 54.2 6.0622   3 222    18.7  5.33 36.2\n6 0.02985  0  2.18    0 0.458 6.430 58.7 6.0622   3 222    18.7  5.21 28.7\n\n\n\nsummary(mydata)\n\n      crim                zn             indus            chas        \n Min.   : 0.00632   Min.   :  0.00   Min.   : 0.46   Min.   :0.00000  \n 1st Qu.: 0.08205   1st Qu.:  0.00   1st Qu.: 5.19   1st Qu.:0.00000  \n Median : 0.25651   Median :  0.00   Median : 9.69   Median :0.00000  \n Mean   : 3.61352   Mean   : 11.36   Mean   :11.14   Mean   :0.06917  \n 3rd Qu.: 3.67708   3rd Qu.: 12.50   3rd Qu.:18.10   3rd Qu.:0.00000  \n Max.   :88.97620   Max.   :100.00   Max.   :27.74   Max.   :1.00000  \n      nox               rm             age              dis        \n Min.   :0.3850   Min.   :3.561   Min.   :  2.90   Min.   : 1.130  \n 1st Qu.:0.4490   1st Qu.:5.886   1st Qu.: 45.02   1st Qu.: 2.100  \n Median :0.5380   Median :6.208   Median : 77.50   Median : 3.207  \n Mean   :0.5547   Mean   :6.285   Mean   : 68.57   Mean   : 3.795  \n 3rd Qu.:0.6240   3rd Qu.:6.623   3rd Qu.: 94.08   3rd Qu.: 5.188  \n Max.   :0.8710   Max.   :8.780   Max.   :100.00   Max.   :12.127  \n      rad              tax           ptratio          lstat      \n Min.   : 1.000   Min.   :187.0   Min.   :12.60   Min.   : 1.73  \n 1st Qu.: 4.000   1st Qu.:279.0   1st Qu.:17.40   1st Qu.: 6.95  \n Median : 5.000   Median :330.0   Median :19.05   Median :11.36  \n Mean   : 9.549   Mean   :408.2   Mean   :18.46   Mean   :12.65  \n 3rd Qu.:24.000   3rd Qu.:666.0   3rd Qu.:20.20   3rd Qu.:16.95  \n Max.   :24.000   Max.   :711.0   Max.   :22.00   Max.   :37.97  \n      medv      \n Min.   : 5.00  \n 1st Qu.:17.02  \n Median :21.20  \n Mean   :22.53  \n 3rd Qu.:25.00  \n Max.   :50.00  \n\n\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of our response variable, medv (median house values)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=medv))+\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of median house values\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is a unimodal distribution, with most home values hovering around 20.\nNow let’s look at one of the possible predictors of median house values, crime rate, and how that relates to the median house values in a scatterplot\n\nggplot(data=mydata, aes(x=crim, y=medv))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nFor this specific case, there appears to possibly be an inverse relationship between house value and crime, but it is hard to tell since so many of the houses have a crime value of 0 or near to 0. Interestingly, it appears that there are no instances of high median house value (&gt;30) that have any crime value over 10.\nTo identify some other potential variables, let’s run a full correlation on the dataset with median house value. From there, we can pick out the top 5 or so features by absolute value correlation score to include in our linear prediction model.\n\ncorrelation &lt;- cor(mydata)\nmedv_correlation &lt;- correlation[,ncol(correlation)]\nmedv_correlation &lt;- sort(abs(medv_correlation), decreasing = TRUE)\nmedv_correlation\n\n     medv     lstat        rm   ptratio     indus       tax       nox      crim \n1.0000000 0.7376627 0.6953599 0.5077867 0.4837252 0.4685359 0.4273208 0.3883046 \n      rad       age        zn       dis      chas \n0.3816262 0.3769546 0.3604453 0.2499287 0.1752602 \n\n\nThe top 5 values are lstat, rm, ptratio, indus, and tax. Let’s now make a linear model predicting medv with these 5 values and see the summary of the model.\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(medv~lstat + rm + ptratio + indus + tax, data = mydata)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = medv ~ lstat + rm + ptratio + indus + tax, data = mydata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-14.2469  -3.0629  -0.9032   1.7415  30.3402 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
